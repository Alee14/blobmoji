For contributing I recommend simply forking the repo, making the changes and starting a Pull Request with some sort of explanation.  
If you need any help, simply open up an issue.  
Please bare in mind that this project itself is just a fork and I don't know very much about all these details.

### Tools:

#### Code
I won't ~~tell you what code editor to use~~ intervene in religious conflicts. I'm not crazy.

#### Assets
In this case I use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org). It's available for GNU/Linux, Windows, Windows 10, Mac OS and I think it's even available for Android.
More details can be found in the Wiki.


However it might be possible that I don't respond that quickly - this might be because I'm either busy or I'm simply not sure about what or how to respond.  

But thanks for any effort .
